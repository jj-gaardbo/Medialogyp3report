	Garden design is a time demanding and expensive service to hire. Hence only people sitting with a newly built house or garden, will even consider the notion of hiring a garden architect. As technology evolves, new mediums to demonstrate the next great garden design to a client gets introduced\cite{landscapeArchitectureDigiTech}. First it was 3D scenes, built to convey the design of the garden, now the next big step in technology is Virtual Reality\cite{VRS}, and with it comes the possibility to demonstrate garden designs to clients in a whole new way.\\
	
	Garden architects themselves find it hard to fully incorporate 3D design into their workflow. The process is time consuming and difficult to learn, hence only a few actually make use of it, and even fewer don't charge additionally for this service. 
	
	\section{Initial problem statement}
	How can the garden design process be improved by putting the user in a 3D VR environment created from a simple sketch using image processing?
