	Designing a garden can be a time demanding and expensive affair. However, people with a newly built house or garden, might consider the notion of hiring a landscape- or garden architect. As technology evolves, new mediums to demonstrate the next great garden design to a client gets introduced\cite{landscapeArchitectureDigiTech}. First it was 3D scenes, built to convey the design of the garden, now the next big step in technology is Virtual Reality\cite{VRS}, and with it comes the possibility to demonstrate garden designs to clients in a whole new way.\\
	
	Some garden architects might find it hard to fully incorporate 3D design into their workflow. The process is time consuming and the software can be difficult to learn, hence only a few actually make use of it, and instead will stick with traditional sketching by hand to communicate their idea to the customers, who might or might not be able to envision fully how the garden will turn out in the end.\\
	
	For the purposes of this project, the focus will be on the design process of a landscape architect and the efficiency of the concept visualization during that process. A prototype of an alternative tool for landscape architects, which includes immersive VR will be presented, evaluated and discussed.
	
	
	
	\section{Initial problem statement}
	How can the garden design process be improved by putting the user in a 3D VR environment created from a simple sketch using image processing?
