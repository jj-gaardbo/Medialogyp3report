 		\subsection{Why a problem?}
 		The design process of landscape architects has been more influenced by modern digital technology over the past 50 years, since Harvard's Laboratory of Computer Graphics was established.\cite{landscapeArchitectureDigiTech} In spite of landscape architects being first-movers in exploring digital applications for spatial analysis, many landscape architects are struggling with conceptualizing digital technology as a creative medium\cite{landscapeArchitectureDigiTech}. A survey on members of ASLA (American Society of Landscape Architects)\cite{surveySketchVSDigital}, shows that a 46\% of landscape architects prefer sketching by hand during the design process instead of using digital tools, 31\% prefer using a computer and the remaining 23\% use the computer for efficiency and the hand for creativity. Based on the statements given by the respondents the survey concludes that; \textit{"computers are not intuitive and design is intuitive"}\cite{landscapeArchitectureDigiTech}\cite{surveySketchVSDigital}. Although, computer software enables visualisation in 3D which is an effective way of communicating large amounts of complex data to a wide non-expert audience, through visual cues that are more intuitive than those of a 2D-sketch, it can be time-consuming to create 3D visualisations.\cite{landscapeVisual}

		\subsection{Why does it matter?}
		
		\subsection{Elderly people's approach to technology}
		It is a stereotype that old people will not search for technology in general, neither as a solution for when they seek to experience things they usually would not be able to, due to their age limitations. In some cases age limitations lead to loss of mobility, and therefore a decrease in life quality. Professional teams have created immersive virtual reality applications like AlohaVR \cite{elderlyVRScout} to help people within the elderly age group to seize their issues such as chronic pain, relaxation issues, anxiety, but also just pure entertainment. \\
		
		The Pew Research Center has studied the technology adoption of elderly citizens in USA during the last 4 years. They created statistics \cite{seniorTechnology} to show the approach elders to technology as seen in \autoref {fig:oldstats1}. Furthermore the study shows estimates on actual use of different technologies by seniors in the age group 65+ years.

			\end{figure} 
		Another statistic shows how large a part of the senior population actually uses Internet and broadband as seen in \autoref{fig:oldstats2}. Nevertheless the graph shows that about 2/3 of the elderly population uses Internet to some extent, which allows the possibility of developing for the age group or including it as an eventual target in a larger target group. Overall these results creates the chance to focus on a different age group, than people usually imagine the technology creators to focus on generally.

		\subsection{Interviews}

		The target group had been defined as "people who go to gardening centers", and as specific as that is (which is very little), we needed to know more about the target group. Do this end, unstructured interviews were conducted at a garden center with its customers. This way we would get a better understanding of both the target group and the context the product would be used in. Furthermore, we also had the option of observing the target group in a natural environment, performing the task that we aim to help them with. Also during this time we had access to staff at the center and could inquire as to what their thought would work \\

	\section{Technologies}\label{sec:technologies}
		\subsection{Virtual Reality}
			The earliest attempts at a VR experience was in the 1950s\cite{VRS} by Morton Heilig who made the Sensorama\ref{fig:sensorama}; an arcade-style theater cabinet, that featured stereo speakers, stereoscopic 3D display, smell generators, fans and a vibrating chair.
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{figure/Analysis/sensorama2}
				\caption{The Sensorama made by Morton Heilig in the 1950s. Fully featured first step at virtual reality.}
				\label{fig:sensorama}
			\end{figure}
			There were a couple of short movies made for the Sensorama, but these were all produced and edited by Morton Heilig himself. The whole setup was stationary, and didn't feature any Head Mounted Display (HMD), so the user had to sit in the vibrating chair and look straight at the display for the duration of the movie. The more modern versions do not include features like smell and fans, but are also geared more towards mobility and full body immersion, and having a vibrating chair doesn't promote that idea.\\\\\texttt{}
			Morton Heilig later went on to further develop the idea of virtual reality, by making the first HMD in form of the Telesphere Mask\cite{VRS} in 1960. This took the immersive nature of his first product to a more personal level, even though it still just were a simple stereoscopic 3D wide view, with stereo sound. It did however look more like the virtual reality headsets of the modern day as seen in \autoref{fig:telesphere}.
			\begin{figure}[H]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{figure/Analysis/TelesphereMask}
				\caption{The first attempt at HMD virtual reality headset, made by Morton Heilig in 1960. It worked by having stereoscopic 3D vision and stereo sound.}
				\label{fig:telesphere}
			\end{figure}
			Even though it was a step in the direction of a functioning virtual reality headset, it was still only a display showing a movie, it didn't have any motion tracking, or interaction between the user and the movie being watched. There was a sore lack of immersion, which is what makes the virtual reality headsets of today what they are.\\\\

			In 1961 the first motion tracking HMD was developed\cite{VRS}, it was made for military purposes, and was focused on tracking the head movements to control a remote camera. This was to allow a soldier to view remote locations in a natural fashion, without risking the viewer to actually be physically present. It used magnets to accomplish the head motion tracking.

			
			\subsection{Fiducial markers}\label{sec:fiducialMarkers}
				By measuring fiducial marker systems, regarding their performance, it is possible to rate the markers by how reliably it finds image points matching physical points on the markers. There can be several reasons to why a fiducial marker system would have problems working or live up to the desired performance. This is typically; poor tolerance to lightning conditions and cluttered scenes causing similar markers to be mistaken by each other\cite{fiducialMarkers}. These problems may complicate the system design.\\
				
				There are however a way to figure out if the fiducial marker system is useful and reliable. This can be characterized by some numerical metrics and some qualitative observations, made with carefulness;\\
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item the false positive rate,
					\item the intermarker confusion rate,
					\item the false negative rate,
					\item the minimal marker size,
					\item the vertex jitter characteristics,
					\item the marker library size,
					\item immunity to lighting conditions,
					\item immunity to occlusion,
					\item perspective support,
					\item immunity to photometric calibration, and
					\item the speed performance.\\
				\end{enumerate}
				
				Failing to properly address these criteria will reduce the usability of a marker system remarkably\cite{fiducialMarkers}. All of the numbers have a valid reason for them to be announced; The false positive rate is falsely reporting the presence of a marker when none is present. The intermarker confusion rate is when one marker is mistaken for another. The false negative rate is when the marker can be seen on an image, but not reported. The minimal marker size is the size of the pixels required for the system to detect the marker. The vertex jitter is the noise in the marker corner positions. The library size is the number of unique markers the system is capable of storing. Two important things from the list is immunity to lightning conditions and immunity to occlusion, for a fiducial marker system it is crucial that the system is able to detect and recognize the markers despite the ambient lighting and partial covering of the pattern.\\
				Last is to mention the practical issue of speed performance. A vision-based fiducial marker tracking system must function in real time, using a low cost computing power, for it to be considered useful.\\
				
				All these criteria can be highly fulfilled using a system called ARTag \cite{fiducialARTag}. ARTag consists of a library of patterns with a square border and unique interior digital signature, along with the possibility to detect algorithms found in imagery \cite{fiducialMarkers}.\\
				
				It is important to state here, that not every kind of pattern in a marker is suitable when it comes to fiducial markers\cite{fiducialMarkers}. As an example it is worth mentioning bar codes, these are not suitable as fiducial markers, because they are made to be read by a laser scanner.\\
				Alongside bar codes follows QR. There are two reasons for this; in fiducial marker systems a large field of view is usually preferred. therefore QR is not suitable for this, mainly because they are not intended for this kind of system.This will cause perspective distortion and they will not provide enough image points for 3D pose calculation.The second reason that QR is not suitable is because they require a large area in the image, this will limit the range as to where the markers can be used.\\ 
				
				
				As stated above, there are a lot of different markers that can be used for a fiducial marker system, but some are more efficient than others, depending on what kind of system will be used.
				Fiducial marker systems is usually functioning in two different stages; hypothesis generation and verification/identification.\\

		\subsection{Other vr applications}
		
			\subsubsection{AlohaVR}
				AlohaVR by One Caring team is an immersive virtual reality application designed to seize the physiological issues elders could be having in their age\footnote{AlohaVR: \url{https://onecaringteam.com/}}. Instead of using pharmaceutical solutions to take away pain, anxiety, issues with relaxation etc. the product takes a neurological approach to solve the potential issues. They created immersive virtual reality landscapes, with the purpose to bring happiness and good memories to life for the elders whilst escaping their reality, which includes the aforementioned issues. One Caring team have monitored some of their users, to research how their virtual reality worlds affects the brain of the user, to further develop and create more effective experiences for the users.
			
		\subsection{Mental Canvas}
			A software system that combines 2D draw-and-paint with 3D\footnote{Mental Canvas: \url{https://www.mentalcanvas.com}} which enables a user to create a 3D environment from sketches, supporting conceptual architectural design and analysis. It has been created for Microsoft's Surface technologies\footnote{Microsoft Surface: \url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface}} and is compatible with the Surface Dial. The system allows for the user to place 2D surfaces, or \textit{canvases} in a 3D space using traditional CAD(Computer-Aided Design) tools of positioning, scaling, rotating on XYZ-coordinate axes.\cite{sotaMentalCanvas}

		\subsection{Reactable}
			Reactivision\footnote{reacTIVision: \url{http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/}} is a framework for developing computervision applications and interfaces. It uses fiducial markers as seen in  \autoref{sec:fiducialMarkers} to sense objects and movement, which allows for more extended interaction. \\
			
			Reactable\footnote{reactable: \url{http://reactable.com/}} is a musical instrument that uses the reactivision framework, to map different controllers on a tabletop interface. The different types of fiducial markers displayed on cubes or small figures work as knobs, buttons and the like to imitate an analog synthesizer, but with different more visual interactions. It enhances the musician's or sound engineer's chance to be more visually creative with their music. The table itself consists of a camera at the bottom pointing upwards to the tabletop. The camera detects interactions made by the user and how the fiducial markers are altered, which results in a musical sound space.
