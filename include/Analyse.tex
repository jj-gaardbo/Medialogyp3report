		\subsection{Elderly people's approach to technology}
		In most cases old people will not search for technology in general as a solution, when they seek to do actions they usually would not be able to, due to their age limitations. In some cases age limitations lead to loss of mobility, and therefore a decrease in life. Teams have created immersive virtual reality applications like AlohaVR\cite{elderlyVRScout}. \\
		
		\subsection{Interviews}

		The target group had been defined as "people who go to gardening centers", and as specific as that is (which is very little), we needed to know more about the target group. Do this end, unstructured interviews were conducted at a garden center with its customers. This way we would get a better understanding of both the target group and the context the product would be used in. Furthermore, we also had the option of observing the target group in a natural environment, performing the task that we aim to help them with. Also during this time we had access to staff at the center and could inquire as to what their thought would work \\

		\subsection{Virtual Reality}
			The earliest attempts at a VR experience was in the 1950s\cite{VRS} by Morton Heilig who made the Sensorama\ref{fig:sensorama}; an arcade-style theater cabinet, that featured stereo speakers, stereoscopic 3D display, smell generators, fans and a vibrating chair.

			\end{figure}
			There were a couple of short movies made for the Sensorama, but these were all produced and edited by Morton Heilig himself. The whole setup was stationary, and didn't feature any Head Mounted Display (HMD), so the user had to sit in the vibrating chair and look straight at the display for the duration of the movie. The more modern versions do not include features like smell and fans, but are also geared more towards mobility and full body immersion, and having a vibrating chair doesn't promote that idea.\\\\
			Morton Heilig later went on to further develop the idea of virtual reality, by making the first HMD in form of the Telesphere Mask\cite{VRS} in 1960. This took the immersive nature of his first product to a more personal level, even though it still just were a simple stereoscopic 3D wide view, with stereo sound. It did however look more like the virtual reality headsets of the modern day as seen in \autoref{fig:telesphere}.

				\label{fig:telesphere}
			\end{figure}
			Even though it was a step in the direction of a functioning virtual reality headset, it was still only a display showing a movie, it didn't have any motion tracking, or interaction between the user and the movie being watched. There was a sore lack of immersion, which is what makes the virtual reality headsets of today what they are.\\\\
			In 1961 the first motion tracking HMD was developed\cite{VRS}, it was made for military purposes, and was focused on tracking the head movements to control a remote camera. This was to allow a soldier to view remote locations in a natural fashion, without risking the viewer to actually be physically present.
