This section aims to explain the strategy and methods employed in order to answer the final problem statement. 

\section{Approach to Design and Implementation}

Talk about demo day, vr and such.

Not very scientific.

Talk about small prototypes to reach goal.

Testing along the way.

Focusing mostly on the technical part, as not much design wise has to be done.

No interface, not much in the design apartment, no real low fidelity prototype.

Why did we do tokens?

Why no interface inside vr?

Possible directions for the design?

Some design requirements.

\section{Initial Research}
\subsection{Garden Centre Survey}

In order to learn more about the people we were designing for, we went where we were sure to find homeowners with their own garden and an interest in keeping that garden nice. Plantorama is one such place, a chain of garden centres with three locations in the Greater Copenhagen area alone. Our location of choice was the Hillerød centre, the largest roofed garden centre in the Nordic countries. 

There, we went to gather responses for a survey. 
The purpose of the survey was to learn the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Who we should expect to be uncomfortable with VR.
	\item Whether or not our product would have a measurable impact if set up in a garden centre.
	\item What sizes our virtual garden must be able to emulate.
	\item Which plants to create as 3D models.
	\item Customers' purchasing ability
	\item Whether the customers' focus are on in- or outdoor plants
	\item Whether or not our proposed product could alleviate problems with choosing plants to buy
\end{itemize}
A survey was created using google forms which would provide insight to answer these questions, and printed in 37 copies. The final survey and results are included in the appendices. The surveys were handed out to customers at Plantorama Hillerød who had their own garden. Two of the forms were discarded as they revealed the respondent had no garden. %tsk, tsk...

\subsection{Expert Interviews}
We also were interested in discovering how professional garden designers, or landscape architects some prefer to go by, work with their clients to create a plan from start to finish. We were particularly curious about their relationship with technology, and to what degree they used 3D visualizations in their work and presentation for the client. 

In \autoref{sec:expertInterviews} it is described how the interviews with these experts were conducted over the phone and how they were recorded with permission and the transcribed versions are available in the appendices.
