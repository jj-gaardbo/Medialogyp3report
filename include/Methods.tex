%Strategy chosen in order to answer the final problem statement.
This section aims to explain the strategy and methods employed in order to answer the final problem statement. 

\section{Approach to Design and Implementation}

%Talk about demo day, vr and such.
In order to know how to approach the design and implementation phases, we knew we had to get an idea of how our prototype should work. Primarily we had to test initial ideas and produce an initial prototype for testing at the mid term demo day on AAU CPH campus to get results. However, before the testing we needed an actual semi-functioning prototype in order to understand how much designing actually would be required for our final prototype.

%Not very scientific.
With the initial idea we did not have a scientific approach to creating an initial semi-functioning prototype. As we wanted to collect data through our research methods to analyse for more scientific results afterwards. Furthermore, we figured the most efficient way would be to have something that could be tested in early stages of the implementation.

%Talk about small prototypes to reach goal.
To reach our goal of having a functioning and testable prototype, it was needed to know how the image processing aspect should function, in order for it to be most efficient and reduce workload simultaneously. Furthermore, these small prototypes should be used for testing along the way, to help structure the idea of a final prototype. \\

%No interface, not much in the design apartment, no real low fidelity prototype.
During early implementation we came to understand, that our prototype would not feature an actual interface in virtual reality, which concluded in no real design issues to be resolved or researched in final order to solve our problem statement. 

%Why did we do tokens?
Our initial idea was to allow for the user to produce a simple sketch of a garden for the camera to recognize eg. colours, shapes, symbols etc. This seemed to be the ideal way of doing the prototype as it would allow creative freedom for the user in what by definition is a creative process. However, the issue with sketching ended being consistency. We still wanted the structure to be simple, but the elements of the prototype to be controlled for consistent recognition. So the use of tokens or fiducial markers came to be the essential solution to achieving the consistency, by having recognizable tokens that should be manipulated within the physical prototype for creating a simple "sketch".

%Why no interface inside vr?
Having the tokens spread on a transparent surface representing the garden design, these physical objects became the interface between the camera and the virtual reality application, which means that our interface design is to be done completely outside of the implementation, but this design should be considered with care to work effectively with the technical part of the implementation.

\section{Initial Research}
\subsection{Garden Centre Survey}

In order to learn more about the people we were designing for, we went where we were sure to find homeowners with their own garden and an interest in keeping that garden nice. Plantorama is one such place, a chain of garden centres with three locations in the Greater Copenhagen area alone. Our location of choice was the Hillerød centre, the largest roofed garden centre in the Nordic countries. 

There, we went to gather responses for a survey. 
The purpose of the survey was to learn the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Who we should expect to be uncomfortable with VR.
	\item Whether or not our product would have a measurable impact if set up in a garden centre.
	\item What sizes our virtual garden must be able to emulate.
	\item Which plants to create as 3D models.
	\item Customers' purchasing ability
	\item Whether the customers' focus are on in- or outdoor plants
	\item Whether or not our proposed product could alleviate problems with choosing plants to buy
\end{itemize}
A survey was created using google forms which would provide insight to answer these questions, and printed in 37 copies. The final survey and results are included in the appendices. The surveys were handed out to customers at Plantorama Hillerød who had their own garden. Two of the forms were discarded as they revealed the respondent had no garden. %tsk, tsk...

\subsection{Expert Interviews}
We also were interested in discovering how professional garden designers, or landscape architects some prefer to go by, work with their clients to create a plan from start to finish. We were particularly curious about their relationship with technology, and to what degree they used 3D visualizations in their work and presentation for the client. 

In \autoref{sec:expertInterviews} it is described how the interviews with these experts were conducted over the phone and how they were recorded with permission and the transcribed versions are available in the appendices.
