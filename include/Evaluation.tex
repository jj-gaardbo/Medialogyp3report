\chapter{Evaluation}
To ensure that the prototype satisfied our final problem statement, we had to evaluate our prototype through an usability and user experience combined test. 

\section{The usability test}
In order to find out to which degree our prototype met our usability and user experience requirements, we conducted a combined usability and user experience test

\subsection{Test goals}
The main goal of this test was to figure out if our target group perceived the prototype's usability and that the user experience was satisfaction. Although our original idea was that this test should be tested on our experts, unfortunately this was not possible which led us to test the prototype on regular students from AAU CPH, but in role as a garden designer and the customer.\\
Efficiency??\\
Learnability??\\
Safety???\\

\subsection{Sampling}
The combined usability test was conducted with the help of (number) participants. We used convenience sampling to find students at AAU CPH.

\subsection{Test specifics}
In \autoref{fig:test1} seen below, is the setup for our usability test.

	\label{fig:test1}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{The equipment being used during the test}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] A camera running on a computer
	\item[-] The box where the tokens is placed with a camera inside
	\item[-] Laptop for filling out a questionnaire
	\item[-] HTC vive VR unit
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Location and schedule}
The test took place Thursday 7/12 2017 in our group room at Aalborg University Copenhagen on Frederikskaj 12. Each testing with evaluation took approximately 15 to 20 minutes.

\subsection*{Test procedure}
Firstly, the participant was informed about the general purpose of the test, tasks and that they would give their consent to being filmed. After agreeing to this, the participant was asked to take the role of a client or an architect. Then they where asked to act like they needed a new garden and find out how the design should look. The client would take on the VR goggles and the architect would make a design with the markers with the help from the client. Afterwards the participants would switch roles and do the same thing again.

*Insert steps here*\\

After the participants tried their different roles they where asked to fill out a questionnaire (see appendix ??) as their respective roles, so each participant had to fill out two questionnaires. The questionnaires contained questions regarding the experience as a client and an architect.

\subsection{Results}
In this section we will display the results conducted from our questionnaires that the participants filled out after each role in the test (see \autoref{fig:boxPlotResults} and \autoref{fig:boxPlotResults2}). The questionnaires was not 100\% Likert scale questions, but we took those out and put them in a box plot. Some of the questions will be picked out and shown in a bar chart.
The questions is as follows:\\

Client Questions:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Rate the amount of discomfort you experienced during the test.
\item Was the framerate (the frequency at which the screen updates) tolerable?
\item How engaged did you feel with the program?
\item How good did the environment and objects look?
\item Did you feel you had enough space to move around?
\item Could you easily communicate with the other participant?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Was the framerate (the frequency at which the screen updates) tolerable?}
As seen in \autoref{fig:barChartFrame}, 3 of the 8 participants didnt find the framerate very tolerable. 1 participant found it somewhat tolerable and 3 participants found it very tolerable.

\subsection*{How engaged did you feel with the program?}
Out of 8 participants, 7 of them strongly agreed that they felt engaged with the program. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:barChartEngaged}

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}


\subsection*{Could you easily communicate with the other participant?}
2 of the participants strongly disagreed that they were able to communicate with the other participant, where 6 of them strongly agreed that it was easy to communicate with the other participant. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:barChartCommunicate}.

\begin{figure}[H]

Architect questions:\\
How easy was the product to use?\\
How easy was it to tell what the garden looked while you were building it?\\

\caption{Box plot graph showing the results of the architect Likert questions.}
\label{fig:boxPlotResults2}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{How easy was the product to use?}
Out of 8 participants 1 of them strongly disagreed that the product was easy to use, while 2 participants hit the middle ground and 5 participants agreed that the product was easy to use. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:barChartEasy}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
	\begin{axis}[ybar,bar width=0.8cm,enlargelimits=0.1,legend style={at={(0.5,-0.2)},anchor=north,legend columns=-1},ylabel={Participants},symbolic x coords={Strongly disagree - 1,2,3,4,Strongly agree - 5},xtick=data,nodes near coords,nodes near coords align={vertical},x tick label style={rotate=35,anchor=east},]

	\end{axis}
	
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Bar chart showing if the product was easy to use.}
	\label{fig:barChartEasy}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{How easy was it to tell what the garden looked liked while you were building it?}
5 participants disagreed that that it was easy to tell how the garden looked, while 3 participants hit the middle ground. This is seen in \autoref{fig:barChartLook}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
	\begin{axis}[ybar,bar width=0.8cm,enlargelimits=0.1,legend style={at={(0.5,-0.2)},anchor=north,legend columns=-1},ylabel={Participants},symbolic x coords={Strongly disagree - 1,2,3,4,Strongly agree - 5},xtick=data,nodes near coords,nodes near coords align={vertical},x tick label style={rotate=35,anchor=east},]
	\addplot coordinates {(Strongly disagree - 1,2) (2,3) (3,3) (4,0) (Strongly agree - 5,0)};
	\end{axis}
	
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Bar chart showing how easy it was to tell how the garden looked like, while building it.}
	\label{fig:barChartLook}
\end{figure}

Besides the Likert scale questions, we also asked some yes/no questions, where some of them will be illustrated in pie charts. 


\subsection*{Were you able to do everything you and the client wanted?}
As seen in \autoref{fig:pie1} over half of the participants answered yes to this question, and a little under half of them answered no.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figure/Evaluation/pie1.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:pie1}
\end{figure}

In addition to this question the participants were able to give a comment, if they answered no to the given question. Here are some examples of the answers:\\

 \begin{quote}
 	
 	\textit{I had a hard time knowing where the client was on the glass plate compared to the items. Sometimes there were some \todo{inconsistency?}consistency in where i placed the item and where it appeared, but i got the hang of it eventually}\\
  \end{quote}
  
  \begin{quote}
  \textit{Orientation is very difficult to understand}\\
  \end{quote}	
 	 
 	As it can be seen from the given answers, some of the participants had a hard time figuring out where the client was in the garden, which made it difficult for them to know where to place the objects in regards to the client.
 

\subsection*{Was it easy to follow the clients instructions?}
A little over half of the participants found it easy to follow the clients instructions, whereas a little under half of them did not find it easy. This can be seen in \autoref{fig:pie2}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figure/Evaluation/pie2.png}
	\caption{.}
	\label{fig:pie2}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Did the program respond accurately to your actions?}
As it can be seen in \autoref{fig:pie3}, half of the participants stated that the program responded accurately to their actions and half of them stated that this was not the case.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figure/Evaluation/pie3.png}
	\caption{.}
	\label{fig:pie3}
\end{figure}

In addition to this question, we asked the participants who answered no to this question, to elaborate on their answer.\\

\begin{quote}\todo{Explain these quotes, can't just let them speak for themselves}
	\textit{bugged out, so it did not show the items in VR}\\
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	\textit{No rotation}\\
\end{quote}

As seen above, one of the participants had some issues with the prototype bugging, and sometimes not showing the object in the VR world. Others complained that it was not possible to rotate the objects, which resulted in the client not having to see how the garden would look like exactly\todo{Rewrite. Doesn't make any sense}.


\subsection{Findings}
In general the participants were positive about our prototype, the Likert scale questions showed an overall understanding of our prototype.
Especially in \autoref{fig:barChartEngaged} it can be seen that all 8 participants felt engaged with the program, when they were in the VR environment. This could have something to do with the result of the question in \ref{fig:barChartFrame}, a majority of the participants answered that the framerate was tolerable.\\

A fair amount of participants answered that they were able to do what the clients asked for. The ones not able to do so complained that the prototype where bugging, and that some of the objects did not appear in VR, this is mostly due to bad lighting and a bad webcam.
A more common statement from the participants were that it was difficult for them to localize the client in the garden. The architect couldn't see where the client was in the garden, because the client was able to move around freely inside the VR garden. Its hard to say how relevant this is, but it is still important to have in mind.\\



\section{Immersion test}
This immersion test was conducted to make a proof of our concept, to make sure that our idea of the prototype was plausible.

\subsection{Test goals}
The goal of the test was to determine if the prototype in fact did answer the final problem statement (\autoref{sec:FPS}). The keywords from the FPS are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] Fast
	\item[-] Efficient
	\item[-] Immersive
\end{itemize}
and hence these were the words we were keen on measuring with this test.
\subsection{Sampling}
Finding real garden architects among the students at AAU CPH, turned out to be a larger challenge than first expected, and therefore it was decided that convenience sampling were to replace that criteria. Convenience sampling among the students at AAU CPH gave us a "random" assortment of test participants. In total, twelve participants were found.

\subsection{Test specifics}
The test consisted of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] 2D sketching
	\item[-] 3D viewing
	\item[-] Virtual reality
\end{itemize}
Between each part, the participant filled out the same questionnaire, changing their answers depending on what test they had just done. Each participant was given a test subject id, starting from 1, and going to 12. To eliminate bias we used every possible combination of 2D sketching, 3D viewing and Virtual Reality on two differently designed gardens.
