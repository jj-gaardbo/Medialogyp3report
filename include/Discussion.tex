\chapter{Discussion}
When evaluating the data acquired during the earlier chapter, it is important to account for two things: validity and reliability. In this chapter we discuss the findings from our evaluation.
\section*{Validity}
	Validity is defined as:\\
	\begin{quote}
		\textit{Validity is concerned with whether the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure}\cite[p.~442~Box~13.3]{interactionDesign}.\\
	\end{quote}
	What this roughly means is, how much the data can be trusted, as in if the there can be potential variations that might invalidate the data. Some potential causes for and against the validity of our two tests could be:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The tests both took place in our group room, where there could have been noise, and distractions from outside people, that could have made the participants less focused on the test at hand.\\
		
		\item Most of, if not all, of the participants that were found utilizing convenience sampling, were students at AAU CPH, and as such aren't very likely representative of how the actual target group would have behaved during the test.\\
		
		\item Due to the semi-structured nature of the immersion test, some participants might have been confused, and therefore not been able to focus completely on the test, but rather on talking with the moderator conducting the test, to make sense of it.\\
		
		\item Both tests had a small sample size, this might have resulted in certain trends not being discovered unless a bigger sample was introduced.\\
		
		\item During both tests we used the same laptop for running the VR unit, a laptop which is not powerful enough to run the virtual environment smoothly enough to be comfortable (See \autoref{fig:barChartFrame}).\\
		
		\item The participants in both tests, might have given more positive responses, simply due to the fact that most have not tried Virtual Reality before, and even if they had, it is very new and "\textit{cool}" technology that is exciting to play with.
		
	\end{enumerate}

\section*{Reliability}
	Reliability is defined as:\\
	\begin{quote}
		\textit{The reliability or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on separate occasions under the same circumstances}\cite[p.~442~Box~13.3]{interactionDesign}.\\
	\end{quote}
	Which means how much you can rely on the tests producing the same results, under the same circumstances, if the test was run on separate occasions by other researchers. Some of the factors we considered relevant to reliability are:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For the usability test, we made a plan for how the test should be set up, as seen in \autoref{fig:test1}. This was to make it so that every instance of the test ran as close to identically as possible.\\
		
		\item For the immersion test, there's was no such plan, and due to the test being split up into 3 separate parts, it was semi-structured at best. Due to the semi-structured setup of the test, there were also no minimum or maximum time each participant spent on each part, they simply spent the time they each thought was adequate.\\
		
		\item The usability test followed a manuscript (See \autoref{sec:appendixUsabilityManuscript}), to make sure there was as little inconsistency as possible.\\
		
		\item The immersion test did not have any manuscript, but merely some rough and loose guidelines to follow; explaining about the three parts of the test, and that the participant should try to visualize being in the garden. This could potentially make it harder to replicate the test procedure.\\
	\end{enumerate}
	The tests have shown that the prototype might have some usefulness for people role playing as garden architects. The tests has proven the prototype as a proof of concept, wherein other researchers can continue development and study in the future.
