\chapter{Discussion}
When evaluating the data acquired during the earlier chapter, it is important to account for two things: validity and reliability.
\section*{Validity}
	Validity is defined as:\\
	\begin{quote}
		\textit{Validity is concerned with whether the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure}\cite{interactionDesign}.\\
	\end{quote}
	What this roughly means, is how much the data can be trusted, as in if the there can be potential variations that might invalidate the data. Some potential causes for and against the validity of our two tests could be:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The tests both took place in our group room, where there could have been noise, and distractions from outside people, that could have made the participants less focused on the test at hand.\\
		
	\end{enumerate}
\section*{Reliability}
	Reliability is defined as:\\
	\begin{quote}
		\textit{The reliability or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on separate occasions under the same circumstances}\cite{interactionDesign}.\\
	\end{quote}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For the usability test, we made a plan for how the test should be set up, as seen in \autoref{fig:test1}. This was to make it so that every instance of the test ran as close to identically as possible.\\
		
		\item For the immersion test, there's was no such plan, and due to the test being split up into 3 separate parts, it was semi-structured at best. Due to the semi-structured setup of the test, there were also no minimum or maximum time each participant spent on each part, they simply spent the time they each thought was adequate.\\
		
		\item The usability test followed a manuscript, to make sure there was as little inconsistency as possible.\\
	\end{enumerate}
