\chapter{Discussion}
When evaluating the data acquired during the earlier chapter, it is important to account for two things: validity and reliability.
\section*{Validity}
	Validity is defined as:\\
	\begin{quote}
		\textit{Validity is concerned with whether the evaluation method measures what it is intended to measure}\cite{interactionDesign}.\\
	\end{quote}
	What this roughly means, is how much the data can be trusted, as in if the there can be potential variations that might invalidate the data. Some potential causes for and against the validity of our two tests could be:\\
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The tests both took place in our group room, where there could have been noise, and distractions from outside people, that could have made the participants less focused on the test at hand.\\
		
		\item The usability test followed a manuscript, to make sure that was as little inconsistency as possible.\\
	\end{enumerate}
\section*{Reliability}
	Reliability is defined as:\\
	\begin{quote}
		\textit{The reliability or consistency of a method is how well it produces the same results on separate occasions under the same circumstances}\cite{interactionDesign}.\\
	\end{quote}
